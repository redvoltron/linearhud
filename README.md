<a>UPDATE INFO</a>
====
here i've listed the updates that need to happen for each site the hud is on. this is because these platforms put my hud to the front page when i update, meaning its only ideal to update every once in a while rather than frequently. i will update gamebanana more than huds.tf, saving huds.tf updates for rare ocasions.

<a>LIST OF UPDATES GAMEBANANA IS BEHIND ON</a>
====
- targetid things
- item counters centered
- medic charge fixed
- hitmarker
- flag score customizations
- better player status
- lowered flag status
- raised damage account
- demoman pipes icon customization
- added menu_thumb_missing
- grower
- mvm fix

<a>LIST OF UPDATES HUD-DB IS BEHIND ON</a>
====
- grower
- mvm fix

<a>KNOWN BUGS</a>
====
- alternate ammo position is broken when using higher clip sizes (for example the snipers SMG)
- enabling then disabling streamer mode breaks many things
- loadout button overlaps with spectator health
- payload race elements overlap with damageaccount
